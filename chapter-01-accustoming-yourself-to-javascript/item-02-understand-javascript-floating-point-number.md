# Understand JavaScript Floating Point Number

## Contents
* All number in JavaScript are double-precision floating-point numbers, that is, the 64-bit encoding of numbers specified by the `IEEE 754 standard-commpnly` known as `doubles`.The doubles can represent integers perfectly with up to 53 bits of precision.

* The bitwise arithmetic operators are special. They implicitly convert then to 32-bit integers.

## Things to Remember
* JavaScript numbers is double-precision floating-point numbers.
* Integers in JavaScript are just a subset of doubles rather than a separate datatype.
* Bitwise operators treat numbers as if they were 32-bit signed integers.
* Be aware of limitations of precisions in floating-point arithmetic.
